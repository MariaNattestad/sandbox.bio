Hopefully this tutorial gave you a good sense of the kinds of things you can do with `awk` on the command line.

`Awk` is indeed a powerful language (we didn't even cover functions, or how to output to files from within an `awk` script!).

Although we ended doing some interesting ~~math~~ data science in some of the steps, keep in mind that `awk` is most commonly used for quick one-liners, and that you generally would want to switch to a language like Python for more complex transformations or analyses.
