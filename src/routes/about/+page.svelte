	<p class="lead">sandbox.bio features interactive tutorials for bioinformatics tools in a secure sandbox.</p>

	<p class="lead fw-bold mt-4 mb-1">Tutorials</p>
	<p>
		Command-line tutorials are powered by <strong>a Linux OS that runs in your browser</strong>! (specifically, Debian 11). The sandbox comes
		preloaded with commonly used bioinformatics tools, so you can hit the ground running, with no setup required.
	</p>

	<p>
		This sandbox is powered by the <a href="https://github.com/copy/v86" target="_blank">v86 project</a>. Its main limitation is that tools that
		cannot be compiled to a 32-bit i686 architecture are not supported.
	</p>

	<p class="lead fw-bold mt-4 mb-1">Playgrounds</p>

	<p>
		Playgrounds on sandbox.bio are powered by a lighter approach, using the <a href="https://biowasm.com" target="_blank">biowasm project</a>.
		Individual command-line tools were compiled to WebAssembly so they can run in the browser. The playgrounds use sample data from
		<a href="https://github.com/TheUpshot/chipotle">The UpShot</a>.
