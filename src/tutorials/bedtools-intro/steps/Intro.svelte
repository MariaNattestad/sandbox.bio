<p>Our goal is to work through examples that demonstrate how to explore, process and manipulate genomic interval files (e.g., <code>BED</code>, <code>VCF</code>, <code>BAM</code>) with the <code>bedtools</code> software package.</p>

<p>Some of our analysis will be based upon the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6099/1190" target="_blank">Maurano et al.</a> exploration of DnaseI hypersensitivity sites in hundreds of primary tissue types.</p>

<p>This tutorial is merely meant as an introduction to whet your appetite. There are many, many more tools and options than presented here. We therefore encourage you to read the <a href="https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">bedtools documentation</a>.</p>
